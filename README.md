👋 Hi, I’m @egor-no

🌱 I'm a Java Developer with 3+ years of experience in the IT industry

👀 I’m also interested in history of programming and IT, music, arts and foreign languages

🙌 If you are a recruiter and you want to offer me a job... do it! But first check out my repositories with pet projects 

💞️ I don't know what else to write here but I liked this emoji-list that github offered me as a template

📫 Feel free to contact me
