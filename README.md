👋 Hi, I’m @egor-no

👀 I’m interested in music, vinyl, foreign languages, history of programming and IT (and that's why I'm here) 

🌱 I’m learning Java and everything else that's needed to find my first job as a Java developer

🙌 If you are a recruiter and you want to offer me a job... do it! But first check out my repositories with training projects 

💞️ I don't know what else to write here but I liked this emoji-list that github offered me as a template

📫 Feel free to contact me
